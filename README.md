# Vid2Ascii
Eventually video to ascii art...

For now the functionality will only be images.

## Requirements
- numpy
- colorama
- Pillow

## Roadmap
1. Figuring out a way to print out the video at its original speed 
   1. Support multiple framerates and resolutions
   2. Possibly use pyte due to having to clear out the terminal every frame
   3. Printing takes time away from frame for bigger videos
2. Store converted files 
   1. Storing as full text is way too long
   2. Design a way to "read" these converted files and play them back
3. Possibly create alternative interface (gui/website?)
